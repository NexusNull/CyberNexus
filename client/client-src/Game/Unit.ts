/**
 * what does a unit need?
 * components
 * where do we get components
 * array of component names
 * how do we store components
 * different Unit tiers
 * core:
 * basic core
 * simple core
 * advanced core
 * sub commander core
 * commander core
 *
 *
 *
 * component types:
 *  chassis defines the movement options
 *  chassis:
 *  vertical drive| allows for relatively fast vertical movement with limited horizontal movement
 *  simple walker| semi high mobility up 1 block high medium speed cheap not able to act while moving
 *  advaced walker| high mobility 2 blocks high can act while moving medium speed
 *  wheel drive | fast fragile not able to move up blocks
 *  tracks | high hp slow not able to move up blocks
 *  static| can't move very durable essentially a tower
 *
 *  armor:
 *  iron weak
 *  titanium stronk
 *
 *  mounts:
 *  mining drill| can mine materials and actually get's resources, low reach
 *  mining laser| vaporises material semi fast but destroy mined resources medium reach
 *  machine gun| high rate of fire medium damage
 *  laser gun| high rate of fire low damage high accuracy
 *  cannon | slow rate of fire high damage
 *  gauss cannon| slow rate of fire massive damage high energy usage

 *      components:{
